### Machine Learning Algorithms Overview

#### Supervised Learning:

**Classification Algorithms:**

- **Logistic Regression:** Predicts categories (spam/not spam in emails).
- **Decision Trees:** Splits data based on features (loan approval).
- **Random Forest:** Combines decision trees for accuracy (customer churn).
- **Naive Bayes:** Uses probabilities for classification (news categorization).
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Groups data based on similarity (flower species).
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Creates boundaries between classes (fraud detection).

**Regression Algorithms:**

- **Linear Regression:** Predicts continuous values (house prices).
- **Ridge Regression:** Reduces overfitting in linear regression (salary estimation).
- **Lasso Regression:** Selects features in linear regression (mileage prediction).
- **ElasticNet:** Balances L1 and L2 regularization (sales estimation).
- **Decision Trees (for Regression):** Predicts continuous values (used car prices).
- **Gradient Boosting Machines:** Corrects errors sequentially (stock price forecasting).

**Neural Network-Based:**

- **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP):** Deep learning for complex patterns (digit recognition).
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** Specialized for images (object identification).
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** Sequences and time-series data (stock prediction).

#### Unsupervised Learning:

- **K-Means Clustering:** Groups data by similarity (customer segmentation).
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Creates clusters hierarchically (taxonomy creation).
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Reduces data dimensions (image compression).

#### Semi-Supervised Learning:

- **Self-training:** Uses limited labeled data with unlabeled data (text classification).
- **Co-training:** Learns from multiple perspectives/views (image analysis).

#### Reinforcement Learning:

- **Q-Learning:** Decision-making in uncertain environments (game strategies).
- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Deep learning for complex tasks (game AI training).
