#### Supervised Learning

- **Classification Algorithms:**
  - *Logistic Regression:* Predicts categories (spam/not spam in emails).
  - *Decision Trees:* Splits data based on features (loan approval).
  - *Random Forest:* Combines decision trees for accuracy (customer churn).
  - *Naive Bayes:* Uses probabilities for classification (news categorization).
  - *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):* Groups data based on similarity (flower species).
  - *Support Vector Machines (SVM):* Creates boundaries between classes (fraud detection).

- **Regression Algorithms:**
  - *Linear Regression:* Predicts continuous values (house prices).
  - *Ridge Regression:* Reduces overfitting in linear regression (salary estimation).
  - *Lasso Regression:* Selects features in linear regression (mileage prediction).
  - *ElasticNet:* Balances L1 and L2 regularization (sales estimation).
  - *Decision Trees (for Regression):* Predicts continuous values (used car prices).
  - *Gradient Boosting Machines:* Corrects errors sequentially (stock price forecasting).

- **Neural Network-Based:**
  - *Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP):* Deep learning for complex patterns (digit recognition).
  - *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):* Specialized for images (object identification).
  - *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):* Sequences and time-series data (stock prediction).

#### Unsupervised Learning:
